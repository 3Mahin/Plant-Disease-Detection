# **Plant Disease Detection**

## **CSE 299 Project (NSU)**

This is an AI model trained to detect Plant Leaf Diseases.

The project is hosted on **`Streamlit.app`** and can be viewed through by clicking this **[link](https://mahinpdd.streamlit.app/)**

It also comes with an **`Android Application`** which you can download throught the following **[repository](https://github.com/3Mahin/Plant-Disease-Detection-App)**

## **Introduction**

I've always loved gardening. As a child, I planted various fruit seeds, hoping to watch them grow. Unfortunately, most of the plants developed diseases that I couldn’t identify. And at the time, being broke, I couldn’t afford professional help to figure out what was wrong.

Now, after 19 years, I’ve created a model that can detect and diagnose plant diseases, making it easier for gardeners like me to care for their plants.

## **Installation**

To make Plant Disease Detection model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: **`git clone https://github.com/3Mahin/Plant-Disease-Detection`**
2. Go to this link and download this dataset (Kaggle): **`https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset`**
3. Make a folder and download the following: **`Train_Plant_Disease.ipnyb`**
4. Unzip the dataset to the folder root.
5. Make sure you have installed the following: **`Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tensorflow, Keras`**

## **Usage**

To use the detection model, follow these steps:

1. Open the folder where you have stored everything.
2. Install streamlit using the following command in the terminal **`pip install streamlit`**
3. After everything is ready: Run the **`Train_Plant_Disease.ipnyb`** file
4. Wait for it to train the model **`Takes about 3hrs more or less depending on system`**
5. As an output you will get the model.
